Hi there!

I am Ying Zhang, first-year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/) at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/), where I work with Prof. [Fabian E. Bustamante](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~fabianb/) at [AquaLab](https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/).

My research interest focuses on Networkings and Systems, especially measuring the consolidation and reliability of Internet. I am particularly insterested in and working on Submarine Cable Networks (SCNs), Video streaming qualities and Content Delivery Networks (CDNs).

Previously, I completed my Bachelor's at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Master's at Northwestern University. My past work experience resonates with my research, I had industry experiences at Bytedance Inc and Rubrik Inc.
